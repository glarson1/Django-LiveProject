# Django-LiveProject
## Introduction
For two weeks in my time at The Tech Academy, I worked along side my peers as a team to create a website for hobbies using Django. The team took part in daily stand-ups to prepare for our sprints. We used DevOps to stay on track and organized. I better understood version control and learned new front end and back end skills while working in a team. We each created webpages for a hobby we each chose. I created my webpages around recipes. The two weeks were broken down into stories that each individual did at their own pace. The stories starting out had to do with the front end and UX, while the later stories revolved around gathering user input and backend database work as well as integrating an API to my portion of the site.
## Front End Stories
First few stories were just to get a basic look for the pages and to get them linked to the main page.
